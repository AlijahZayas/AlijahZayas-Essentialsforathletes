        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Alijah Zayas, I grew up in a small city called Wilmington, California. I attend the University of California, Riverside. I am currently a junior and studying Economics/ Administrative Studies with a concentration in marketing. I attend the University of California, Riverside. Growing up I always enjoyed playing and watching sports. It was a passion of mine to play as many sports as I could and also watch as many sports as I could. With that being said I have always been interested in working with athletes and sports companies, which I hope to do so in the near future. That can be getting deals for players or helping better a brand with their essentials, and marketing skills. I think it is very important for Athletes to interact with their fans, with the right marketing they will be able to get their message heard. 
<br><br>

        Teamwork is the most important thing when it comes to sports. I feel like it is very important for employees to work together and create a healthy environment. Communication and great social skills will play a role in this. It is very important to learn about sports and do the research of companies I work with. When researching these sports teams and sports companies you learn a lot of insight on what they are about and how they operate. I would want my clients to get the best deal with these companies so I research a lot of information. When I played sports it showed me the side of what the athletes see and want. It is a plus knowing both sides of the industry. My main goal is to make all parties happy with the different deals handled. 
<br><br>

        When I was in high school I was the girls basketball team manager. I learned most of my skills while helping out the administration and team coach. I would communicate with both the players and coaches to make sure everyone gets what they need and deserve. I have great organizational skills which are essential when working with a team. I would make sure the team was on time to practice, had rides to games, took score and notes for the coach for errors made in the game and practice. I also created team bonding activities so the team can connect and work better together. I also was in a club at the boys and girls club where I learned a lot about marketing. We would have to plan events for the other children to attend and have fun. We would make flyers, games, activities, and provide food for all of those who attended our events. The most important part in these events were the marketing because we wanted people to want to attend. Social skills, flyers, and communication made all of the events successful.
